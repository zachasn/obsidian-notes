# Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals

## Section I: Transition from Common Moral Knowledge to Philosophical
In this section, Kant argues that the only thing that is unconditionally good is a **good will**. Unlike talents, gifts, or even happiness, a good will is intrinsically valuable regardless of what it accomplishes. The moral worth of an action comes not from its consequences or the inclination behind it, but from acting **from duty**, following the moral law because it is the right thing to do.

Kant distinguishes between:
- Actions that merely **conform to duty** (done for self-interest or inclination)
- Actions done **from duty** (motivated by respect for moral law itself)

Only the latter has true moral worth. This section establishes that morality must be grounded in reason, not empirical observation or feelings.
## Section II: Transition from Popular Moral Philosophy to the Metaphysics of Morals
This section introduces the **Categorical Imperative** as the supreme principle of morality. Kant distinguishes between:
- **Hypothetical imperatives**: Conditional commands (if you want X, do Y)
- **Categorical imperatives**: Unconditional moral commands that apply universally

The famous formulation: **"Act only on that maxim whereby thou canst at the same time will that it should become a universal law."**
##### The Autonomy of the Will as the Supreme Principle of Morality
Kant argues that true morality requires **autonomy** - the will determining itself through rational principles rather than external forces. The will must act according to universal laws that could apply to all rational beings. Moral action means legislating universal laws through one's own reason while simultaneously subjecting oneself to those same laws.
##### Heteronomy of the Will as the Source of all spurious Principles of Morality
**Heteronomy** occurs when the will is determined by external forces, inclinations, or desires rather than pure reason. Such principles are "spurious" (false) because they depend on contingent, empirical factors rather than arising from rational necessity. Any moral system based on consequences, feelings, divine commands, or self-interest fails to be truly moral because it derives from heteronomy.
##### Classification of all Principles of Morality which can be founded on the Conception of Heteronomy
Kant classifies heteronomous principles into two categories:
- **Empirical principles**: Based on physical feeling (happiness, self-love) or moral feeling (sympathy)
- **Rational principles**: Based on perfection (either ontological perfection or theological concepts of divine will)

Both categories fail as foundations for morality because they impose obligations from outside the will rather than by pure practical reason.
## Section III: Transition from the Metaphysics of Morals to the Critique of Pure Practical Reason
This section explores how categorical imperatives are possible and establishes the connection between freedom, reason, and moral law.
##### The Concept of Freedom is the Key that explains the Autonomy of the Will
Freedom is not mere randomness but the capacity to act according to laws that reason gives to itself. A free will and a will under moral law are identical. Freedom is both **negative** (independence from empirical determination) and **positive** (the capacity to legislate universal law). This positive freedom is what makes autonomy possible.
##### Freedom must be presupposed as a Property of the Will of all Rational Beings
All rational beings must regard themselves as free when acting, even if theoretical proof of freedom is impossible. This is because to deliberate and act rationally presupposes that we are not merely mechanically determined. We must act "under the idea of freedom," which for practical purposes is equivalent to being free.
##### Of the Interest attaching to the Ideas of Morality
Kant addresses why we should care about morality. Pure reason itself provides interest in moral law without requiring external incentives. However, explaining how pure reason can be practical (motivating action) remains at the boundary of philosophical understanding. We can recognize our obligation to the moral law but cannot fully comprehend how it motivates us.
##### How is a Categorical Imperative Possible?
The categorical imperative is possible because rational beings exist in two worlds:
- The **sensible world** (phenomenal realm) - where we are subject to natural causation
- The **intelligible world** (noumenal realm) - where we are free and self-legislating

As members of the intelligible world, we recognize the moral law, as members of the sensible world, we experience it as an imperative (ought). This dual citizenship explains how synthetic a priori moral judgments are possible.
##### Of the Extreme Limits of all Practical Philosophy
Kant concludes by acknowledging the limits of moral philosophy. We cannot explain how freedom is possible or how pure reason can be practically motivating as these questions exceed human understanding. We can only show that morality presupposes freedom, that freedom must be presupposed for rational agency, and that the moral law is valid for all rational beings. Philosophy reaches its proper boundary here: establishing the validity and necessity of moral law without claiming to explain its ultimate metaphysical ground.
