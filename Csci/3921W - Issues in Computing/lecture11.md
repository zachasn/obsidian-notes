## 1: Open Source AI: To Release or Not To Release the GPT-2 Synthetic Text Generator


I think Utilitarianism has the hardest time what the right or wrong action was in regards to the release of GPT-2 because even though they were aware that the model could be used for deceptive purposes, how do they exactly measure this concern against the overall benefits of releasing the model to the public? The potential for misuse is  high, but at the same time, the potential for positive applications is also high. I think they made the right decision to release a smaller version of the model first but they should have put more guardrails in place before releasing the full model.

What does the ACM code of ethics and ACM/IEEE-CS software engineering code of ethics have to say here? what elements?
Section 1.2 of the ACM code of ethics applies here, "Avoid harm." The potential for misuse of the GPT-2 model could cause harm to individuals and society as a whole. I also think section 1.3 applies, "Be honest and trustworthy" because they were honest about the potential risks of releasing the model and took steps to mitigate those risks.
