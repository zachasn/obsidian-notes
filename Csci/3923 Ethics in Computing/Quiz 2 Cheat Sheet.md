**INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY**
COPYRIGHT: Life+70y (hire:95y) | PATENTS: 20y | Copyright: tangible expression, original, fixed | Patents: useful, nonobvious, novel | Trademark: name/logo, USPTO, renewed ∞ | Trade Secrets: secrecy, NDAs | Fair Use: education/research/criticism/news/parody | First Sale: control 1st sale only
**DISINFORMATION**
US: NO comprehensive online privacy law | Dominant Propaganda: Flooding = uncertainty (many narratives) NOT fake sources | Techniques: Distraction, Ad hominem, Cherry-picking, Gaslighting, Truth weapon, Proxies, Astroturfing, Flooding, Counternarratives
**FALLACIES**
Ad hominem: attack person not arg | Either-or/Excluded middle: only 2 options | All-or-nothing: must be perfect | False cause: correlation=causation | Confirmation bias: seek confirming info | Hindsight: "knew it" | Virtuality: online = no consequences | Ambiguity: imprecise terms | Appeal to authority/people: source/many = true | Begging question: circular | Composition/Division: parts=whole | Dunning-Kruger: low competence overestimate | Eyewitness: over-rely testimony | Fallacy fallacy: fallacy ∴ false conclusion | Prosecutor's: confuse P(E|G) w/ P(G|E) | Single cause: complex=1 cause | Slippery slope: chain extremes | Many-any: many=any
DK Quote: overrate ability → visit fake news, can't distinguish, share false (ethics beyond intentions)
**AI LEARNING**
Learners can't assess AI usefulness | Over-rely = superficial learning | NOT all experts pro-AI curriculum | Struggle KEY to learning; shortcuts = poor | Process = product | Don't acknowledge: shame, unclear rules (NOT ACM) | Learning: knowledge, terms, tools, perspectives, critical thinking, problem-solving, communication
**ALGORITHM FAIRNESS**
NOT just dev care - systemic | Errors: Data (incorrect, biased), Model (design), Interpretation (spurious, Simpson's), Use (contexts, thresholds, FP/FN) | Tech NOT neutral - design "baked in" | Multiple fairness definitions | Need technical+social | Address: awareness, ALL stakeholders, appropriate techniques, external review, transparency/auditability, democratic input | Technomoral Wisdom: technical+social (Vallor)
**PRIVACY**
1965: Nat'l Data Center (Gallagher/Orwellian) | 1990s: Cookies (active→passive) | 2013: Snowden NSA | Cambridge: 270k quiz→87m harvest; 40k voters/3 swing states
Surveillance Capitalism (Zuboff): experience=raw material, behavioral surplus, prediction products, modification
Evolution: Active→Passive (exhaust, IoT, cross-context) | Collection→Inference | De-anon problem (Netflix/IMDB) | Inference permanence (trained models) | AI infers: behavior, protected chars, psych, API keys | Meta AI: chats in feed, profile linked, NOT WhatsApp E2E
**TECHNOMORAL ETHICS (Vallor)**
Virtue Ethics: hard foresee consequences, universal rules w/ dynamic tech | 12 Virtues: 1.Honesty 2.Self-control 3.Humility 4.Justice 5.Courage 6.Empathy 7.Care 8.Civility 9.Flexibility 10.Perspective 11.Magnanimity 12.Technomoral wisdom | TM Wisdom: moral choices+technical+social (deepfakes, bots, algorithms) | Cultivation: practice, self-exam, relations, moral attention | Phronesis: practical wisdom, best action in context
**LLMs**
NOT sentient - pattern text generators | Can't assess capabilities - no stable knowledge (distributed params) | ChatGPT changed landscape but limited | Don't ask about mistakes - generate plausible, not reflect | Word vectors: words→numbers | Transformers: attention (relevant words) + feedforward (think) | Training: back propagation, learn patterns | Public know: not sentient, can't self-evaluate
**KEY DISTINCTIONS**
Copyright≠Patents (duration) | Propaganda=flooding/uncertainty NOT fake sources | US NO online privacy law | Excluded middle≠ad hominem (2 options vs attack person) | Dunning-Kruger=overestimate w/ low competence
**ALG FAIRNESS - Why NOT "be careful":**
1.Multiple error sources not oversight | 2.Tech not neutral-design embedded | 3.Different fairness defs-need democratic input | 4.Need technical+social expertise | 5.Systemic solutions: stakeholder consult, audits, transparency | 6.Human bias too-algorithms can be fairer IF thoughtful | 7.TM wisdom-technical+social
