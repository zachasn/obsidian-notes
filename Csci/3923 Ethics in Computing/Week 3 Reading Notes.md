## A Framework for Ethical Decision Making
- **What is Ethics?:** Ethics is how people should act in many situations. Ethical decision making should not be based on  feelings, religion, science, law, or accepted cultural norms. Instead many philosophers, ethicist, and theologians have come up with different lenses that people can use to make ethical decisions.
#### Ethical Lenses
###### The Modern Rights Lens 
- The best decision is the one that best protects and respects the *moral rights* of those affected. Stems from that Kant's believe that humans have a *dignity* based on their ability to choose freely what they do with their lives (human nature).
- *Negative Rights:* These rights impose a *negative* duty on others. For example, the right to privacy imposes on us a duty not to intrude into the private activities of a person.
- *Positive Rights:* Positive rights impose a *positive* duty on us.  Each one of us has duty to help others in fulfilling basic constituents of human well-being like health and education. For example, a young person's right to an education imposes on us a duty to provide that young person with an education. These rights require more than just acting, we also have to sustain the welfare of those who are in need.
- **Question:** Which option best respects the rights of all who have a stake?
###### The Justice Lens
- The best decision is the one that treats people fairly and distributes benefits and burdens *equitably* according to some standard like need, merit, contribution, or equal treatment. 
- There are different types of justice that address what people are due in various contexts such as **social Justice**, **distributive justice**, **corrective justice**, **retributive justice**, and **restorative justice**.
- **Question:** Which option treats people fairly, giving them each what they are due?
###### The Utilitarian Lens
- Result based approach, says that best decision is the one that produces the *greatest* balance of good over harm for as many people as possible
- **Question:** Which option will produce the most good and do the least harm for as many stakeholders as possible?
###### The Common Good Lens
- The best decision is the one that best serves the *shared interests* and *collective well-being* of the community as a whole. Highlights mutual concern for the shared interests of all members of a community.
- **Question:** Which option best serves the community as a whole, not just some members?
###### The Virtue Lens
- The best decision is the one that reflects and cultivates excellent *character traits* and moral virtues. 
- **Question:** Which option leads me to act as the sort of person I want to be?
###### The Care Ethics Lens
- The best decision is the one that maintains and strengthens relationships and responds compassionately to the needs and vulnerabilities of particular people, especially those we're connected to.
- **Question:** Which option appropriately takes into account the relationships, concerns, and feelings of all stakeholders?

## Why Machine Ethics?
- The first section of the article talks about driverless machines and if they are cable of making ethically decisions. He uses the classic trolly problem to explain whether these driverless machines are capable of making split second ethical decisions and if software engineers should introduced algorithms that make these decisions.

## Questions/Challenges
1. What if different ethical theories lead to different conclusions? Or even different people using the same ethical theory reach different conclusions?
2. Why do I need to know different theories if the way I make moral decisions is different from all of them?
3. Do people actually use the ethical theories when making decisions?
4. Are there other ethical theories we have not talked about?
5. Given none of the ethical theories is perfect, why not give up?

## Possible Answer
1. Many individuals' moral systems use part of different theories and resolve conflicts as part of their decision making. So different theories providing different might not be an issue in some individual decisions.
2. Using ethical theories might help us better understand others' views on a topic. Can also deepen our decision-making process.
3.  Sometimes people explicitly use ethical theories and  often they implicitly use them.
4. Yes, there are many. few are **James Moor's Just Consequentialism** and **"Paramedic Ethics"**

### Example
- Suppose you are working on a software development company and there is a rumor that the company is monitoring all employee email that passes through company servers. Suppose further that your boss, knowing your are taking this course, asks you to prepare a policy recommendation as to whether the company should or should not be allowed to monitor employee email. What sort of process do you use in deciding what recommendation to make? And how do you explain and justify your recommendation to the people affect by it?
