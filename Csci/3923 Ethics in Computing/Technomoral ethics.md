# Technomoral ethics
Book by Shannon Vallor, "*Technology and the Virtues: A Guide to a Future Worth Wanting*", virtue- or character-based ethics approach
## Technomoral Virtues
- Book argues that virtue ethics is more useful than utilitarianism or deontology, e.g., due to the difficulty of foretelling consequences or to constructing universal rules given the far-reaching and dynamic state of computing technology.
- Grounds virtues not only in Western philosophy (Aristotle, Scholasticism, etc.), but also in Buddhist and Confucian ethics.
##### Vallor's Technomoral Virtues:
- Honesty
- Self-control
- Humility
- Justice
- Courage
- Empathy
- Care
- Civility
- Flexibility
- Perspective
- Magnanimity
- Technomoral wisdom

**Technomoral wisdom** includes not only the wisdom to make good moral choices when confronted with an ethical issue, but also an understanding of both relevant technical and social aspects of technomoral issues. (Some examples: the ease of making deepfakes; that much posted material online is generated by bots, bad actors, etc; that social media often promotes material to maximize user time on the site; ...).
## Cultivation of Virtues
- Virtue-based ethics includes cultivating virtues.
- Vallor mentions a number of aspects of this such as practicing behavior involving virtues, engaging in reflective 
- self-examination, seeing virtues in light of relations, and developing sufficient moral attention.  
- Virtue ethics also emphasizes phronesis, i.e., practical wisdom. This is the ability to discern the best course of action in a specific situation, taking into account ethics in  general and the situationâ€™s context, and then being able to apply ethical knowledge effectively
