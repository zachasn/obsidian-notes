# Intellectual Property
Intellectual property is a complicated area, with many gray areas. Even so, it’s useful for computer practitioners to know something about the basics in this area, and about some current issues. 

Intellectual property is best seen not in terms of possession of an object, but in terms of control of an object’s use by others.
## Learning Goals
- Be able to explain basics.
- Be able to explain why this is an important, interesting, and complicated area.
- Be able to explain or analyze given scenarios, comments, issues, etc. with respect to what we’ve learned in the class.
## Types of  Intellectual Property
- Trademark
- Trade Secrets
- Patents
- Copyright
- User Licenses (e.g, EULAs)
## Trademark
- Name, logo, etc. that identifies a company or a product.
-  Examples
- Trademark must be distinctive
- Trademark must be registered with USPTO
- Trademark can renewed indefinitely as long as it is actively used
##### Example Case
“The Supreme Court sided with booking.com on Tuesday, green-lighting the booking accommodations website to trademark the generic term associated with their domain name.” (June 30, 2020 CNN story, https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/30/politics/booking-trademark-supreme-court/index.html)
## Trade Secrets
- Company relies on secrecy
-  Examples
- Relies both on secret not being disclosed and product or process not being independently rediscovered or reverse engineered
- Role of limited knowledge among employees, nondisclosure agreements, etc.

##### Example Case
“Anthony Levandowski, the former Google engineer and serial entrepreneur who was at the center of a lawsuit between Uber and Waymo, has been sentenced to 18 months on one count of stealing trade secrets.” “Levandowski admitted to downloading thousands of  files related to [Google’s] Project Chauffeur.” (Aug. 4,  2020 TechCrunch story, https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/anthony-levandowski-sentenced-to-18-months-in-prison-as-new-4b-lawsuit-against-uber-is-filed/)

## Patents
- Applies to inventions and discoveries
- Can cover machines or processes, but not ideas, algorithms, natural laws, numbers, etc
- Needs to be useful, nonobvious, and novel
- Patents prohibit others from manufacturing, using or selling the invention or process without the patent holder’s permission.  
- Gives 20 year monopoly
## Copyright
- Covers tangible expression of an idea in a fixed medium
- Includes writings, photographs, maps, musical compositions and performance recordings, software, etc 
- Work must be original, nonfunctional (and not patentable), and fixed in a tangible medium
- Original length of copyright: 14 years + possible 14 year renewal  
- Current length of copyright: life of the author plus 70 years (“works for hire” slightly different: 95 years)
- Copyright is limited by first sale and fair use doctrines  
- First sale allows copyright holder to control first sale, but then the purchaser may resell the work, give it away, etc. (but not copy it for resale, etc.)
- Fair use allows use of the copyrighted work for education, research, criticism, news reporting, parody, etc.
## Licenses
- EULA = End User Licensing Agreement
- Software licenses often specify the terms of use of software (e.g., to specify the terms under which the company allows copying of the software), and may address additional issues (liability). Licenses are more of a contract than a fundamental means of intellectual property right protection. Once again, exactly what is and is not legal in licenses is a disputed area.
