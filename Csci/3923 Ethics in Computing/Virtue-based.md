## Overview
Rooted in Aristotelian philosophy, focuses on character traits and moral excellence rather than rules or consequences. It asks "What kind of person should I be?" rather than "What should I do?" In computing, it emphasizes cultivating good character traits in technologists and designing systems that promote human flourishing.
