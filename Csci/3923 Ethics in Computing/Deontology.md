# Deontology

## Overview
Deontological ethics focuses on the inherent rightness or wrongness of actions themselves, regardless of consequences. Actions are moral or immoral based on whether they conform to moral rules, duties, or principles.

## Key Principles
- **Duty-Based**: Actions are right when they fulfill our moral duties
- **Universal Moral Laws**: Some actions are inherently right or wrong, universally
- **Means vs. Ends**: The means matter as much as (or more than) the ends
- **Human Dignity**: People must be treated as ends in themselves, never merely as means

## Kant's Categorical Imperative

### First Formulation: Universal Law
"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law"
- Would you want everyone to act this way?
- Could this principle be universally applied?

### Second Formulation: Humanity Formula
"Act so that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, always as an end and never merely as a means"
- Respect human dignity and autonomy
- People have inherent worth beyond their usefulness

### Third Formulation: Kingdom of Ends
"Act as if you were legislating for a kingdom of ends"
- Consider yourself and others as both subject to and creators of moral law

## Key Figure
- **Immanuel Kant** (1724-1804): Primary developer of deontological ethics

## Applications in Computing Ethics
- **Privacy Rights**: Individuals have inherent right to privacy, regardless of benefits of data collection
- **Informed Consent**: Duty to obtain genuine consent before using someone's data
- **Algorithmic Transparency**: Obligation to be honest about how systems work
- **Digital Rights**: Fundamental rights that cannot be violated even for greater good

## Strengths
- Provides clear, universal moral principles
- Protects individual rights and dignity
- Not dependent on calculating uncertain consequences
- Treats all people equally with inherent worth
- Provides moral certainty and stability

## Criticisms
- **Rigidity**: May require following rules even when consequences are clearly harmful
- **Conflicting Duties**: What to do when moral duties conflict with each other?
- **Cultural Relativism**: Are moral principles truly universal across cultures?
- **Practical Limitations**: Difficult to apply in complex real-world situations

## Examples in Computing

### Privacy and Surveillance
- **Deontological View**: People have inherent right to privacy that cannot be violated
- Even if mass surveillance prevents crime, it treats people merely as potential threats

### AI and Automation
- **Deontological View**: Workers have dignity and right to livelihood
- Cannot simply replace humans with AI based solely on efficiency calculations

### Data Collection
- **Deontological View**: Must obtain genuine informed consent
- Cannot collect data without permission even if it would benefit society

### Algorithmic Decision-Making
- **Deontological View**: People have right to understand decisions affecting them
- Obligation to provide transparency even if it reduces system effectiveness

## Comparison with Utilitarianism
| Aspect | Deontology | Utilitarianism |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| Focus | Rules/Duties | Consequences |
| Flexibility | Rigid principles | Adaptable to situations |
| Individual Rights | Absolute protection | May be sacrificed for greater good |
| Decision Making | Follow moral rules | Calculate best outcomes |
