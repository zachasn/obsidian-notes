### Week 1
1. My hopes about ChatGPT and generative AI in general is that it will with learning. My worries about ChatGPT and generative AI is that I might become too reliant on it and not develop my own skills as much as I could otherwise.
2. One ethical issue I see with generative AI is the potential for it to be used to create misleading and harmful content.
3. Computing has changed how we communicate, similar to how the telephone and radio did. It has also created new industries and jobs like automobiles and electrification did. Computing is more versatile and can be used for a wider range of applications from communication to entertainment. Its also evolving more rapidly than other technologies.  
4. I learned about different views on technology like technological determinism, optimism, and pessimism.
5. I learn about prompting techniques from a classmate.  
6. I use generative AI to help me learn new technologies and concepts faster. I also use it as a study aid.
### Week 2
1. I would tell them that ethics is important because our code has real word consequences that extend far beyond the technical systems we’re building, so its important to avoid or mitigate harm. 
2. I learned about different ethical frameworks, how people use them to make decisions and the advantages and disadvantages of each one.
3. From a classmate I learned that generative AI uses something classed “word vectors” to reason about relationships between words.
### Week 3
1. I think one reason is that students might think that citing AI is  basically admitting to not doing the work themselves, which could be seen as a lack of effort or laziness. They might also worry about how their instructors will perceive them if they cite AI.  
2. I learned what technomoral virtues are and how they relate to ethics in computing, particularly when it comes to generative AI.  
3. I found the poll about what framework my classmates used to make moral decisions interesting. I thought a lot more people would say utilitarianism or deontology but the majority said rights, justice, or fairness based.
### Week 4
1. One important thing I learned about ethics from another student is the significance of transparency in AI systems. It's crucial for users to understand how AI models make decisions and what data they are trained on to ensure accountability and trustworthiness.  
2. One way I see generative AI changing the content I encounter online is through the creation of more personalized and interactive experiences. For example, AI-generated content can be tailored to individual preferences, making online interactions more engaging and relevant. However, this also raises concerns about echo chambers and the spread of misinformation, as AI can generate content that reinforces existing beliefs without critical evaluation.  
3. One thing we can all do to work against the problem of misinformation online is to  practice critical thinking and fact-checking before sharing any information. By taking a moment to verify the credibility of sources and cross-referencing information with reliable outlets, we can help prevent the spread of false information and promote a more informed online community.  
4. How can we effectively measure and mitigate biases in AI models that are trained on  large datasets, especially when those datasets may contain inherent societal biases?
### Week 6
1. Ethics are important in computer security because they help guide the actions of security professionals.They also help ensure that security professionals do not abuse their power or access to sensitive information.  
2. What strikes the most about the Equifax incident is there response to the incident. They did not have a good way for users to check if they were affected.  
3. As users, we can learn more about the technical and non technical sides of security. As future professionals we can follow good code and system development practices.
