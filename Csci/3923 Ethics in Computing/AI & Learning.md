# AI & Learning
## General Questions
- What should we say about AI use in CSci and classes?  
- What type of guidance can we give ourselves, each other, other students, friends, etc.?  
 - When (if at all) should students use AI in their classes and learning in general?  
- If you use it, how do you use it ethically?  
- What is most beneficial to us? 
- What is fairest to everyone?
## Some Perspectives On AI Usage
- *Completely*: Revamp the entire curriculum to an AI-focus and let, in fact require, students to use AI in major ways to do all their classwork.
- *Extensively*: Give students a wide berth in using generative AI.
- *Moderately*: In some ways and at some times, but not others.
- *Minimally*: Allow some uses, but only a small amount.
- *Not at all*: Ban all uses of generative AI.

Which of these best represents your current view?

## Why This Topic?
- Your learning

-  Ethical development, fairness
-  Future professional development and practice
## Educational Research
What does educational research say about when AI helps learning and when  
it hinders it?  
One point is “learning” means more than just “learning the material”, i.e., not  
only learning discrete facts, but also a larger matrix of learning abilities. 
- This includes background knowledge, use of terminology, common tools, perspectives, etc. (This is one reason why, e.g., it is important to do reading rather than ask an AI to summarize it.)
- It also includes developing critical thinking skills, problem solving skills, communication skills.  
- Put another way, not only is the product (e.g., answer) important to learning, but so it the process we use to obtain it.
##### Learning Materials *Well*
It is too easy to over-rely on generative AI.
- In general, it is difficult for learners to evaluate when generative AI use helps or  harms learning when they are in the process of learning material. Educational  research shows many learners over-rely on generative AI, often thinking it will help them learn more efficiently, but the actual effect is superficial learning.  
- One concern for teachers is when they see students doing well in work where generative AI is allowed (or where illicit use might be occurring), but then doing poorly on work when generative AI is not allowed.  
- It is a human tendency to take short cuts. But some struggle in learning is a key part of the learning process. Skipping or short-cutting this will mean you do not learn something well.
