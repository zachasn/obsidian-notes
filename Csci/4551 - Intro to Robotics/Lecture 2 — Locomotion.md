## Robot Sensors
- Devices that can sense and measure physical properties of the environment
	- e.g., temperature, luminance, resistance to touch, weight, size, etc
- Key phenomenon is transduction
	- Transduction (engineering) is a process that converts one type of energy to another
- Deliver low-level information about the environment the robot is working in
	- Returns an *incomplete* description of the world
- This information is noisy (imprecise)
- Cannot be modeled completely:
	- Reading = *f*(env), where *f* is the model of the sensor
 - Finding the inverse:
	 - *ill posed* problems (solution not uniquely defined)
	 - collapsing of dimensionality leads to ambiguity
- **Types of Sensors**
	- Active versus Passive:
		- *Active* → emit energy in environment, is more robust, less efficient, e.g. sonar, radar
		- *Passive* → passively receive energy from environment, less intrusive but depends on environment. e.g. light for camera
	- Contact versus Non-contact:  tiny sensor that prevent robot from running in obstacles
	- Examples:
		- Proprioceptive Sensors → monitor state of robot
			- *IMU* (accels & gyros)
			- *wheel encoders*
			- *Doppler radar*
		- Exteroceptive Sensors → monitor environment
			- *Cameras (single, stereo, omni, FLIR, ...)*
			- *Laser scanner*
			- *Sonar*
			- *Tactile*
- **Sensor Characteristics**
	All sensors are characterized by various properties that describe capabilities
	- *Sensitivity* = change of output / change of input
	- *Linearity* = consistency of output/input
	- *Measurement/Dynamic range*: difference between min and max
	- *Accuracy*: difference between measured & actual
	- *Repeatability*: difference between repeated measures
	- *Resolution*: smallest observable increment
	- *Bandwidth*: result of high resolution or cycle time
