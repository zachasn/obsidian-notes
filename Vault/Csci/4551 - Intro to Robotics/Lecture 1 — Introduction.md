## Course Objective
- **Robotics**, and especially **mobile robotics**
- How can they **sense** their environment? 
- How do they **plan** for a given task?
- How do they **act** on the plan?
- How do you 'program' robotic behaviors
- How do (are) these robots  (going to) **interact** with people?
## Robotics
- robotics is poised to re-shape our world both societally and economically
	- *It will be the primary way computer science is embedded in the word.*
- What device isn't going to be smart?
	- *Microwaves, cars, planes, drones, phones, ...*
- "Synthetic Science" may play the role in this century that Natural Science played over the last 500 years!
## Course Concerns
- Robots are on the verge of becoming genuinely commonplace.
- What is a robot?
	- an *intelligent machine* that can sense and act on the word
- How does a robot interact with the world around it?
	- *Sense-plan-act*
- How do robots (and people) work (together) in the *field*?
	- *field* implies an environment, outdoors or indoors, that is not specifically engineered for robotic systems, and where people function in their professional or personal life
## Course Style
- Mixture of lectures, (possibly) guest lectures and class presentations
- *Target audience:* students interested in robotics, Artificial intelligence, cognitive science or (applied) computer vision
- emphasis is on *mathematical representations, algorithms, inference mechanisms and behavior strategies*
- Encompassing perception, learning and execution
- Although we will survey the kinds of mechanical and electronic systems that constitute a robot today
## Topics
- Robot locomotion strategies
- Workspace representations
- Motion planning
- Robot sensing
- Localization and mapping
- Filtering and state estimation
- Mobile robot navigation
- Robot programming
- Robot simulation
- Human-Centered robotics
## Prerequisites
- We do not teach deep learning in this class
- You must have a strong background in linear algebra, software dev/coding, systems
	- if you are weak in any of these areas, please reconsider being in this class
	- I or your TA will not cover requisite fundamentals
## Evaluation
-  Homeworks - 30%
-  Lab - 20%
-  Midterm - 30%
- Final project - 20%
## Final Project
- The project is a key part of the course
- You have freedom in selecting the topic, so long it is related to robotics
	- *A purely ML/Vision/Interaction project will not be appropriate*
- The final project will consist of a robotics task (perception/localization/interaction, etc) accompanied by a report and a short in-class presentation
- Feel free to start looking for a topic **ASAP!**
- Be prepared to take on systems-centric work
- We will only look at projects in simulations
	- *Common simulators do exist (e.g. ROS Gazebo)*
- Anticipate and allocate time and resources
## Labs
- Introduction and experimentation with the robot operating system
- Workstations are Ubuntu 24.04, with ROS 2 Jazzy installed
	- Learn to use ROS2, you can install it on your own machine
	- Software representations of sensing, localization, mapping, planning, etc
- Anchor concepts into pragmatic implementations on simulated robots
## Work requirement
- **Unless explicitly stated, you are required to work independently on your homework, lab assignment, project, and the likes.**
-  Im fairly considerate:
	- **But not when you're cheating**
	- **Academic integrity policy will be strictly enforced**
	- **First instance of plagiarism gets you a zero, second instance results in an F grade**
- Unless asked to do so by the instructor or TA, do not use any AI tools do your class assignments (homework/lab/projects)
- Research all you want but you are expected to limit your use of AI to aid in your learning, not offload to it.
## Robotics
- **Definition (broadly):**  The science and engineering of replicating the attributes of living begins, and humans in particular in machines
- Encompasses artificial intelligence, computational vision, machine learning, psychology, mechatronics and "traditional robotics"
- Major resurgence of deep science, technological breakthroughs in the last 10 years
- Really using robots depends on interacting with people
- Significant economic impact already
- used in environments that are:
	- Dangerous
	- Inaccessible
	- Expensive to access
	- Tiring
	- Inhospitable
- e.g., Exploration, radiation cleanup, military surveillance, hazardous waste assessment
