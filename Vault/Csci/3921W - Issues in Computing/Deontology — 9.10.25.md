### Overview
- Deontology says that every action is determined to be right or wrong based on a set of roles. With this set of rules, can every action be considered right or wrong? What issues may arise from that approach?

### Golden Rule
- Treat others as you would like to be treated (*positive or directive form*)
- Do not treat others in ways that would not like to be treated (*negative or prohibitive from*)
- What you wish upon others, you wish upon yourself (*empathetic or responsive from*)
### In-class writing 
1. Some rules I try to live by are:
	- Be honest with myself and others because the truth will inevitably come out one way or another, so there's really no point in lying, it just creates more problems down the road.
	- Follow through with promises and commitments you make because to me, promises and commitments you make are not only to others but to yourself, and if your word doesn't have any value to you, what value would
	- Treat everyone with respect and compassion until they give you a reason not to
	I follow these rules because the truth will inevitably come out one way or another, so there's really no point in lying, it just creates more problems down the road. promises and commitments you make are not only to others but to yourself, and if your word doesn't have value to you, what value would it have to others? Finally, everyone wants to be respected and loved, and I think that's a basic thing all people deserve. However, some people will try to take advantage of this kindness, so it's important to have boundaries and know when to protect yourself.

2. No, I don't agree with this statement. I think there are situations where universal maxims can conflict. For example, say some guy with a gun comes to your house and demands to know if  your friend is hiding in your house. According to Kent's universal maxims, you should not lie, but you should also protect your friend. In this situation, you have a moral dilemma. Do you tell the truth and risk your friend's life or do you lie and protect your friend? To me, this is a situation where I would lie to protect my friend because I value their life more than the universal maxim of not lying.
