## Overview
Utilitarianism is a consequentialist ethical theory that judges actions based on their outcomes or consequences. The fundamental principle is to maximize overall happiness, well-being, or utility for the greatest number of people.

## Key Principles
- **Greatest Good for Greatest Number**: Actions are morally right if they produce the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of people
- **Consequentialism**: The morality of an action is determined solely by its consequences
- **Hedonistic Calculus**: Systematic way to calculate pleasure and pain to determine the best course of action

## Types of Utilitarianism

### Act Utilitarianism
- Evaluate each individual action based on its specific consequences
- What produces the best outcome in this particular situation?

### Rule Utilitarianism
- Focus on rules or principles that generally produce the best consequences
- What rule, if universally followed, would produce the best outcomes?

## Key Figures
- **Jeremy Bentham** (1748-1832): Founder of modern utilitarianism
- **John Stuart Mill** (1806-1873): Refined the theory, distinguished between higher and lower pleasures

## Applications in Computing Ethics
- **Data Privacy**: Balancing individual privacy against societal benefits of data collection
- **AI Development**: Weighing potential benefits against risks to society
- **Resource Allocation**: Distributing computing resources to maximize overall benefit
- **Automation**: Considering job displacement against productivity gains

## Strengths
- Provides clear, measurable criteria for ethical decisions
- Focuses on outcomes that matter to people's lives
- Promotes impartiality and equal consideration of interests
- Intuitive appeal - most people want to maximize good outcomes

## Criticisms
- **Measurement Problem**: How do we quantify and compare different types of happiness/utility?
- **Justice Concerns**: May justify sacrificing individuals for the greater good
- **Demanding Nature**: Requires constant calculation and may be psychologically unrealistic
- **Rights Violations**: Could justify violating individual rights if it maximizes utility

## Examples in Computing
- **Trolley Problem for Autonomous Vehicles**: Programming decisions about who to save in unavoidable accidents
- **Platform Content Moderation**: Balancing free speech against harm prevention
- **Algorithmic Bias**: Accepting some bias if it produces better overall outcomes
