# Privacy
### Why does privacy matter?
- technical challenge
- Personal stake
- Code you write may handle information from millions of people
### Early Digital Privacy Concerns (1960s-70s)
- 1965 National Data Center proposal  
	- Would consolidate birth records, census, medical, tax, and Social Security data  
	- Rep. Cornelius Gallagher’s 1966 hearings - Warned of “Orwellian” surveillance capabilities
	- Concern that government could compile complete dossiers “from cradle to grave” with the push of a button
	- Even basic computerization could allow unprecedented tracking
### Internet-Era Privacy Shifts
- Cookies (1990s): active consent -> passive tracking
- Cross-site tracking allows comprehensive behavioral profiles
- These forms of data collection are largely invisible and often require opt-out
### Political Context
- 2009-2017: NSA programs expanded
	- 2013 Snowden whistleblowing event exposed mass NSA surveillance of digital communications
- Metadata = behavioral intelligence
	- Patterns can reveal personal details without content
- Public-private surveillance partnerships  
- “Secret Law”: FISC rulings on electronic surveillance hidden from public
### “Surveillance Capitalism” (Zuboff, 2019)  
- Human experience as raw material  
-  Companies gather “behavioral surplus” - data beyond what’s needed for service improvement  
- Prediction products - selling certainty about future behavior  
- Behavioral modification - ads shape future actions  
- New form of control through automated systems
### Cambridge Analytica Scandal
- Facebook likes predict attributes with 85-95% accuracy (Kosinski et al., 2013)  
- Psychological profiling determined personality traits from digital traces
	- 270k users took personality quiz, data from 87m harvested
	- Consent loophole - friends’ data collected without permission
- Micro-targeting based on psychological profiles
	- 40,000 voters in 3 swing states potentially tipped 2016 election (Berghel, 2018)
- Academic research weaponized
-  Regulatory failure
### Group Discussions
1. What issues or incidents have you heard about that involve computing and privacy?
	 - 
2. How do you think AI changes the landscape of privacy and computing?

# From Data Collection to Data Inference
Traditional active collection required conscious user participation:
- Form submissions, surveys, account registration
- Clear value exchange - data for service
- Moments of consent and awareness

Modern passive collection operates continuously (Lin & Loui, 1998):
- Digital exhaust - every interaction generates data trails (Zuboff, 2019)  
- Ambient data (IoT sensors, smart home devices, wearables collecting 24/7)  
- Cross-context tracking (data follows users across devices, apps, websites)
### Data Inference
- “what you tell us” → “what we can figure out”
- Disparate data sources create detailed profiles when combined
-  De-anonymization problem:
	- Netflix “anonymous” ratings de-identified using IMDB
- Inference Permanence:
	- Deleted data persists in trained models
	- Behavioral patterns learned by AI systems outlive original data
	- “Right to be forgotten” cannot erase statistical correlations
- AI can infer...
	-  Behavioral predictions
	- Protected characteristics
	- Psychological profiling
	- Secret API keys
### Meta AI App Leaks User Chats
- Users unknowingly share private AI conversations (Arntz, 2025; Robison, 2024)  
-  Conversations appear on Meta AI’s “Discover” feed
- Real scenarios:
	- Teacher sharing details about job termination arbitration
	- People seeking help with tax evasion
	- Medical topics
	- Emotional personal conversations
- Privacy trap:
	- Interface feels private
	- With social media integration, conversations linked to profile
	- Conversations used to improve model and reviewed by Meta AI team
	- WhatsApp AI chats NOT protected by end-to-end encryption
