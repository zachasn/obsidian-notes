## Overview
The social contract ethical framework is a political and moral theory that suggests individuals consent to surrender some freedoms and submit to authority in exchange for protection of remaining rights and benefits of living in a civil society.

## Key Concepts

### Origins
- **Thomas Hobbes** (Leviathan, 1651): State of nature is "war of all against all"
- **John Locke** (Two Treatises, 1689): Natural rights to life, liberty, and property
- **Jean-Jacques Rousseau** (The Social Contract, 1762): "Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains"

### Core Principles
1. **Consent of the Governed**: Legitimate authority derives from agreement of those subject to it
2. **Mutual Obligation**: Both individuals and institutions have duties under the contract
3. **Protection of Rights**: Government exists to protect certain fundamental rights
4. **Rule of Law**: Laws apply equally to all members of society

## Application to Computing Ethics

### Digital Rights and Responsibilities
- Users agree to terms of service in exchange for digital services
- Platform governance and content moderation policies
- Data privacy expectations and corporate responsibilities

### Technology Governance
- Regulatory frameworks for emerging technologies
- Professional codes of conduct in computing
- International agreements on cybersecurity and digital rights

### Examples in Practice
- **Privacy Policies**: Implicit contracts between users and service providers
- **Open Source Licenses**: Community agreements governing software use and contribution
- **Professional Ethics Codes**: ACM, IEEE standards as social contracts within computing profession

## Strengths
- Provides foundation for democratic governance of technology
- Balances individual freedom with collective security
- Adaptable to new technological contexts

## Limitations
- Assumes voluntary participation (often not realistic in digital contexts)
- Power imbalances between individuals and corporations/governments
- Difficulty in renegotiating terms as technology evolves
- Questions about who can consent (children, AI systems, future generations)

## Related Frameworks
- Utilitarianism (collective benefit)
- Rights-based ethics (individual protections)
- Virtue ethics (character of institutions and individuals)
