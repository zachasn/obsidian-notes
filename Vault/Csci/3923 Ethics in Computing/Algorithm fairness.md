# Algorithm fairness
## Some (imperfect) Views on Algorithms & Fairness
- Computers are smart; therefore they can make better decisions than humans.
- Technology is neutral, so algorithms are neutral, and therefore fair.
- Algorithms will always contain at least some bias, and so we should not let them make any decisions involving people; only people should make these decisions.  
- Algorithms can be biased; to address this problem all we need is for the people devising the algorithms to be more careful to avoid bias.
- Algorithms can be biased; to address this problem we need the people constructing the algorithms to identify what is fair and make sure the algorithm fulfills that fairness criterion.
## Possible Errors or Issues
- Data issues: data incorrect, data not representative, etc. (Think about what type of biases the data AI is likely trained on might have.)
- Model issues: Parameter choices, weightings, poorly designed model, etc.  
- Interpretation: spurious correlations, misinterpretations (e.g., “Simpson’s paradox”, etc.  
- Use issues: use in unwarranted contexts, use errors based on threshold choices, false positive and false negatives, etc.

## Main Points
- On one hand we shouldn’t be surprised that algorithms can be biased. Replacing human decisions by algorithmic decisions doesn’t magically eliminate all bias. And technology is not neutral, for example, certain design choices are “baked in.”  
- How to construct fair algorithms is a difficult question. And, as we have seen, there are different measures of fairness.
- But that doesn’t mean we give up all together. After all, human decision making can be biased — often unconsciously — as well, so there is at least the potential that ADM systems will help produce fairer decisions.
- This is an area where it is important to understand both the technical and the social issues involved.
- There are a number of reasons why this is a complicated issue; we have only scratched this surface of this topic.
- it is important to be thoughtful, deliberate, knowledgeable, transparent, etc. when constructing and using ADM systems. (Remember Shannon Vallor’s virtue of “technomoral wisdom”)  
- “Democratic societies should be working now to determine how much transparency they expect from ADM systems. Do we need new regulations of the software to ensure it can be properly inspected? Lawmakers, judges, and the public should have a say in which measures of fairness get prioritized by algorithms. But if the algorithms don’t actually reflect these value judgments, who will be held accountable? ... These are the hard questions we need to answer if we expect to benefit from advances in algorithmic technology.”
## Addressing Algorithmic Biases
- Be aware of the issue and different types of errors.  
- Be cognizant of how the algorithm can affect the stakeholders — all the stakeholders.  
- Consult with stakeholders extensively.
- Use appropriate system development techniques.
- Be amenable to external review, e.g., external audits to analyze the fairness of your system. 
- Transparency, traceability, auditability.
- ... (any many more: this is a topic of current discussion — both social and technica — and research)
- See, e.g., the Wikipedia page on algorithmic bias for more  information.
