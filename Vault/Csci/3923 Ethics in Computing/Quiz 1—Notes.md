	- **Example**- *ACM/IEEE:* Social contracts within computing profession
4. **Right-based (Modern Rights):** The best decision is the one that best protects and respects the *moral rights* of those affected. Asks "Which option best respects the rights of all who have a stake?"
	- **Pro:** Respects individual autonomy and self-determination | **Con:** Cultural differences in how rights are prioritized and interpreted

	- **Pro:** promotes good character traits | **Con:** Varying definitions of virtuous behavior across cultures
	- **Example:**-*Open Source Development:* Developers sharing code freely, mentoring newcomers, and prioritizing community benefit over personal gain.
6. **Professional:**  Emphasizes the special obligations and responsibilities that come with professional expertise and social trust. Professionals have duties beyond personal interest serving the public good within their field.
	- **Pro:** Recognizes unique responsibilities of technical experts to society | **Con:** Can conflict with employer demands or personal interests
	- **Example:**-_Software Engineering:_ Following ACM Code of Ethics by refusing to develop software known to cause harm, maintaining professional competence through continuous learning, and prioritizing public safety over corporate profits.
7. **Technological Determinism:** Direction and effects of technology is predetermined and cannot be changed
8. **Technology as Value-Free:** Technology is neutral
9. **Technological Optimism:** Technology is primarily a force for good
