## Summaries
The first article talks about the importance of having AI ethics guidelines in place for organizations that are developing or using AI technologies. Some of the key guidelines mentioned in the article include transparency, fairness, privacy, using LLMs in a way that is sustainable, and ensuring that they train their employees on how to ethically use AI.

The second article lists 12 general guidelines for the use of AI. These guidelines include:
1. Right to transparency: Users should be informed when they are interacting with an AI system and should have access to information about how the system works and what data it uses.
2. Right to human determination: Users should have the ability to opt out of AI systems and
3. Identification Obligation: AI systems should be designed to identify themselves as such and not impersonate humans.
4. Fairness Obligation: AI systems should be designed to avoid bias and discrimination and should be regularly audited to ensure they are operating fairly.
5. Assessment and Accountability Obligation: Organizations that develop or use AI systems should be held accountable for their actions and should be required to conduct regular assessments of their systems to ensure they are operating ethically.
6. Accuracy, Reliability, and Validity Obligation: AI systems should be designed to be accurate, reliable, and valid, and should be regularly tested to ensure they are functioning as intended.
7. Data Quality Obligation: AI systems should be trained on high-quality data that is representative of the population they are intended to serve.
8. Public Safety Obligation: AI systems should be designed to prioritize public safety and should be regularly tested to ensure they do not pose a risk to users or the public.
9. Cybersecurity Obligation: AI systems should be designed to be secure and should be regularly tested to ensure they are not vulnerable to cyberattacks.
10. Prohibition on Secret Profiling: AI systems should not be used to secretly profile individuals or groups without their knowledge or consent.
11. Prohibition on Unitary Scoring: AI systems should not be used to assign individuals a single score or rating that determines their access to services or opportunities.
12. Termination Obligation: AI systems should be designed to be easily terminated or deactivated if they are found to be operating unethically or posing a risk to users or the public.

The third article is about the security risks associated with using AI and how many users and developers of AI don't understand the risks involved. The article discusses how many AI systems are vulnerable to attacks such prompt injections, where an attacker can manipulate the input to an AI system in order to get it to produce a desired output.

## Reflection
1. What is one important thing you learned from the AI Ethics Guidelines reading?
	- One important thing I learned from the AI Ethics Guidelines reading is the importance of transparency when it comes to AI systems. It is important for organizations to be open about how they are using AI and to ensure that they are not perpetuating biases or discrimination.

2. The Universal Guidelines reading listed several guidelines (left hand side of the article). Were there any guidelines there you found surprising? If so, which ones and why? If not, explain why not.
	- I was not surprised by any of the guidelines listed in the Universal Guidelines reading. They all seemed like common sense and important principles to follow when it comes to the use of AI. 
3. In the sloppy AI defenses article, what is:
	- One important thing you learned about AI and security?
		- One important thing I learned about AI and security is that that many AI developers are repeating the same mistakes that were made in the early days of the internet when it comes to security.
	- One thing you learned about technical aspects of AI?
		- I learned that prompt injections are a major security risk for AI systems and that they can be used to manipulate the output of an AI system.
